# UIArchitectureApp
This demonstration project is a showcase of the interoperability between `UIKit` and `SwiftUI`.

Main foundation of UI and main foundation of navigation is done with `UIKit`. 
`UIViewController` is a "container" of UI elements but its main content view is of `SwiftUI` `View` type, as is its entire view hierarchy.
